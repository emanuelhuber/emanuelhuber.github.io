  <p class="description">This project aims to design and perform a series of new field experiments to get insight into the groundwater
	  flow and transport processes, which are controlled by heterogeneously distributed aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity.</p>
	  <p class="description">The combination of direct-push, tracer test, hydraulic heads measurement and geophysics will allows us to
	  to characterise the subsurface heterogeneity, quantify the river waterâ€“groundwater interaction and
	  better understand the link between morphology and sedimentology in term of hydrodynamics.</p>
