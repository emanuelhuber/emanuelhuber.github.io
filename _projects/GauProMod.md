R functions for Gaussian process (GP) modelling. The core functions are coded in C++ and based on the EIGEN library (through RcppEigen)
Notes

Current features:

- Posterior Gaussian Process with Gaussian likelihood (Gaussian process conditioned to noise-free and noisy observations)
- Space-time Gaussian process
- Gaussian Process with monomial mean functions with vague Gaussian prior on the coefficient parameters
- Gaussian Process conditioned to derivative observations
- Covariance function: Matern, Gaussian, linear
- Anisotropic covariance functions (scale and rotation)
- Log marginal likelihood of the Gaussian process
- Cross-matrix distance (distance between every rows of each matrix): crossdist(x,y,M) (with M a positive semidefinite matrix for anisotropic distances)
