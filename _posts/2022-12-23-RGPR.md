RGPR is a free and open-source software package for ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data processing, export/import, visualisation, etc.

RGPR is written in R, a high-level programming language for statistical computing and graphics that is freely available under the GNU General Public License and runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS. R is a highly versatile and extensible language to which C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and run. Furthermore, the R developer community is very active and more than 10'000 packages are hosted on the official global package repository CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network, https://cran.r-project.org). In 2017, R was ranked as the sixth top programming language by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. R is somehow similar to matlab or python (for an interesting comparison between R and python, check https://github.com/matloff/R-vs.-Python-for-Data-Science)

RGPR is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/emanuelhuber/RGPR.
